Overview and goals
- A unified workspace: Open and manage multiple panels or terminals in one window. The Multi-Tab setup keeps related tasks together without losing context.
- Efficient navigation: Shortcuts speed up routine actions. Alias commands reduce repetitive keystrokes and let you work in a consistent, predictable way.
- Extensible by design: A plugin system lets you add features without changing the core. Plugins can modify behavior, add new panels, or integrate with other tools you already use.
- Cross platform by intent: The project aims to provide consistent behavior on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The core ideas translate across environments, with platform-specific niceties handled behind the scenes.
- Stability and clarity: The codebase emphasizes straightforward logic, small, testable units, and clear error messages. The experience should feel calm and reliable.

Why this project matters
- Complex workflows deserve clarity. When you switch tasks or projects, you want a workspace that remembers the important context.
- Shortcuts matter for focus. A well-chosen set of aliases can save minutes each day.
- Plugins unlock your tool’s potential. You don’t have to wait for a feature to be built; you can add it yourself or adopt a community plugin.
- Consistency matters. A single, coherent interface reduces cognitive load and helps you stay productive.

Core concepts
- Multi-Tab workspace: A collection of tabs lets you group related activities. Each tab can host a panel, a console, a shell, or a custom widget defined by a plugin.
- Shortcut aliases: Shortcuts map to commands, sequences, or actions. Aliases can accept parameters and be chained to compound tasks.
- Plugin surface: The plugin system exposes a stable API. Plugins can extend UI, provide data sources, or hook into lifecycle events.
- Configuration model: Settings are stored in a structured form to support easy edits and automation. The model supports per-user and per-workspace scopes.

Key features
- Tabbed interface with fluid switching
- Keyboard-driven workflows with customizable aliases
- Plugin architecture with well-defined extension points
- Built-in command runner and script support
- Lightweight and fast, with sensible defaults
- Clear error handling and helpful messages
- Cross-platform design with consistent behavior

Getting started
- Supported platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux. The project targets desktop environments and seeks to provide a smooth experience on each platform. If you encounter platform-specific quirks, the design favors explicit behavior and clear remediation steps.
- Quick start steps:
  1) Visit the releases page to download the appropriate asset for your platform.
  2) Install or extract according to the package type you downloaded.
  3) Launch the application and complete the initial setup wizard.
  4) Open a few tabs to verify multi-tab behavior. Create aliases for common tasks.
  5) Add a plugin to extend functionality. Start with a simple plugin that adds a panel or one small action.
- Why start with a clean slate: A fresh setup helps you tailor the environment to your needs. You can gradually add keys, aliases, and plugins as you grow more confident with the tool.

Download and installation guidance
- The latest releases include platform-specific assets that you can download and install. Since the releases page hosts the official builds, you should obtain the right file for your OS and architecture.
- To download the latest release, visit https://github.com/MntMed/multi-commander-tools/releases and grab the installer or package that fits your system.
- After downloading, run the installer or follow the platform-specific instructions to complete the setup. If you use a package manager, check for the appropriate package name and install it via the package manager.
- On first launch, you may be prompted to import settings or to set up your first alias. Accept the defaults if you are unsure, then customize as you go.
- If you already have an older version installed, consider importing your existing settings during the upgrade. This helps preserve your workflow, aliases, and plug-ins.

Usage patterns and everyday workflows
- Multi-tab workflow: Each tab represents a separate context. You can switch tabs quickly with keyboard shortcuts or by clicking the tab header. This design keeps related tasks grouped while letting you jump between contexts without losing your place.
- Alias-driven workflow: Shortcuts let you perform common tasks with a single keystroke or a short sequence. Aliases can compose other aliases, enabling sophisticated flows with minimal typing.
- Plugin-driven workflow: Plugins extend the core capabilities. Start with a plugin that adds a panel for a familiar tool, then build on it to integrate more data sources or actions.

Configuring your workspace
- Settings model: The configuration uses a clear structure. You can tailor key bindings, tab behavior, panel defaults, and plugin behavior.
- Aliases: A simple syntax supports strings, parameters, and defaults. Aliases can call other aliases to compose complex tasks.
- Panels: Panels are modular. The core includes a few panels by default, and plugins can add more. You can rearrange panels, resize them, and save layouts.
- Plugins: Plugins declare their capabilities and hooks. They can contribute UI components, commands, and data sources. Plugins load at startup and can be enabled or disabled per workspace.

    }
  }
}

Building your own plugins
- Plugins extend the tool without changing the core. They should be self-contained and opt-in.
- Core plugin points:
  - UI extension: Add panels, panels with controls, or new widgets.
  - Command extension: Define new actions that can be invoked from the alias system.
  - Data extension: Supply data sources used by the UI or automation hooks.
- Plugin API basics:
  - Expose a manifest that declares name, version, and capabilities.
  - Implement a small set of lifecycle hooks (init, activate, deactivate).
  - Provide actions that can be invoked via aliases or UI controls.
- Example plugin ideas:
  - A git dashboard that shows repository status and quick actions.
  - A cloud storage panel that lists buckets and files.
  - A task runner that orchestrates local scripts across tabs.
- Development workflow:
  - Start with a minimal plugin that adds a single button to a panel.
  - Expand by adding a new command that can be bound to an alias.
  - Add UI refinements and configuration options to tailor the plugin behavior.
- Distribution:
  - Package plugins as small modules that the core can load at runtime.
  - Verify plugin compatibility with each core version to prevent breakages.

Shortcut aliases and command patterns
- Simple aliases: Map a short alias to a command or script.
- Parameters: Aliases can accept arguments and pass them to commands.
- Compositions: Build more complex flows by chaining aliases. For example, an alias can run a build command, then run tests, then deploy.
- Context awareness: Aliases can act differently depending on the active tab or panel. Use the context to tailor actions.
- Safety: Aliases should fail gracefully and provide helpful error messages when something goes wrong.

Command references and examples
- alias.find: Executes a search command across all open panels.
- alias.deploy: Packages and deploys a build to a staging environment.
- alias.clean: Removes temporary files from a project directory.
- alias.sync: Synchronizes files between local folders and a remote source.
- alias.list-plugins: Shows a list of enabled plugins and their status.
- alias.open-workspace: Opens a saved workspace layout for quick setup.

Plugins ecosystem and marketplace
- The plugin system invites a growing ecosystem. Developers can publish plugins that enhance the core experience.
- A plugin marketplace provides discoverability. You can browse, install, and update plugins directly from the app.
- Plugins can be versioned, and users can pin plugin versions to ensure stability in their setups.

Security and safety considerations
- Always download releases from trusted sources. Use the official releases page to obtain assets.
- Plugins run with the same privileges as the core application. Review plugin code before enabling it in sensitive environments.
- Keep the core and plugins updated. Regular updates patch vulnerabilities and improve reliability.
- Be mindful of scripts and commands executed via aliases. Prefer safe defaults and validation.

Troubleshooting and common issues
- Startup problems: Check your platform logs to identify missing dependencies or permission issues.
- Alias not triggering: Verify the alias syntax and ensure the command is present in the environment path.
- Plugin failures: Disable plugins one by one to identify the culprit. Review plugin logs for errors.
- Performance concerns: Review the layout and tab count. Large layouts can slow down the UI. Adjust a few panels to restore responsiveness.

Best practices for productive setups
- Start with a clean workspace: Create a basic set of aliases and a minimal plugin set.
- Build gradually: Add one plugin at a time and test its impact.
- Document your workflow: Keep a personal guide that describes your aliases and expected outcomes.
- Back up settings: Regular backups prevent loss if the local configuration is corrupted.
- Share learnings: If you create a useful alias or plugin, consider sharing it with the community.

Extending the README with visuals
- Visuals improve comprehension. Use icons and diagrams sparingly to illustrate concepts like the tab layout, alias flow, and plugin interactions.
- Suggested visuals:
  - A simple diagram of the tab layout showing multiple panels connected by a common workspace.
  - A flow chart for an example alias that chains commands.
  - Screenshots of the main UI with labeled sections (tabs, panels, command bar).
